Craving is an app for foodies who want quality food and often know exactly what they want to eat but donâ€™t always know where to find it.

With Craving you can search for food by dish, filtering by distance and price. Since Craving is an MVP we have yet to populate alot of data. 
I recommend searching the dish "burger" to see the most results and sample the full functionality of the app. You can check out dishes on the list or map view. 
If you click on one of the map pins only the dishes at that restaurant will be displayed. Once you select a dish you will be taken to the dish page
where you can review & rate the dish, "favorite it" to save it to your profile or select "get the dish" to be taken to the restaurant page.  The restaurant
page is populated from the Google places API. The restaurant photo, address & price range are all pulled from Google.  The restaurant rating
is an average rating of all the dishes at the restaurant.  When you are are ready to get the dish you can select either "Book a table" to be
taken to El Tenedor or "Order in" to be taken to Deliveroo. 

On Craving you can also post your own favorite dishes. On this page you can restaurant name and the Google Places app will populate suggestions
as you type. You will also need to add a dish name, price, category and dish photo.  All of your posts will be saved on your profile and available
for other users to view.
